# Weather PWA App

![alt text](./public/app.gif)

This project has been created to practice and learn how to develop PWA.

The purpose of this app is to check the weather in different cities of the world through a text input.

As I have more time I will try to complement and expand the App to do more interesting features.

The app is developed using React JS.

## Try the App:

The app is hosted in a free hosting: https://competent-wright-4be531.netlify.app/

Although the app is online available, you can try it in local:

1. Download or clone the project in your computer.
2. Inside the project: `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Visit `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser


### Version 1

In this version you can only check the weather in different cities by introducing the city in the text field.
